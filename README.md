# Advances in Operating Systems Design
Advanced Operating Systems course taught by [Prof Sandip Chakraborty](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sandipc/) at IIT Kharagpur. 

### About the Repository
The assignments deal with advanced techniques in Operating Systems design such as Loadable Kernel Modules and eBPF. The term project explains several research papers in the domain of Synchronization.

### Contributors
All the assignments were done by me. The term project was done jointly by me, [Seemant G. Achari](https://github.com/pasthorizon) and Satwik Chappidi. Individual contributions are listed in the files.
